 * Curated SEED SLICE — the demo's real-data stand-in.

 * demo runs on a small hardcoded slice so there's NO live integration to break on stage. This
 * is PITCH CREDIBILITY ("grounded in real data"), not a technical dependency. Keep it easy to
 * edit — these files are the knobs we turn to stage the demo.
 *
 * The split: orders (POS history) + the four "signal" datasets the Scout reads — weather,
 * fixtures, holidays, events. The Historian learns patterns from `orders` joined with these;
 * the Scout reports them for the TARGET date.
